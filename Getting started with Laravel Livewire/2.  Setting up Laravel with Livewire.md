Creating new `hello` component via `php artisan livewire:make hello` command, it the end we get class and view created which can be seen at image below:

`Hello` class looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20221102143904.png]]
```php
namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;

class Hello extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.hello');
    }
}
```

`hello` view looks like this:

Updaing view to look like this:
```html
<div>
    Hello
</div>
```

In the end we include our `hello` component inside our `home.blade.php`, there are two ways to include livewire component inside view files: 
1. using `@livewire`  directive and as parameter we give name of component

2. from Laravel 7, you can use component style include or livewire tag (<livewire:name-of-component>):

            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-header">{{ __('Dashboard') }}</div>

                <div class="card-body">
                    @livewire('hello')

	                <livewire:hello></livewire:hello>
