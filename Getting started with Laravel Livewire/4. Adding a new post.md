Creating PostCreate for new posts:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221102152402.png)

Adding post-create view component to post-index view component:
```php
<div>
	<livewire:post-create></livewire:post-create>

    @foreach($posts as $post)
		<livewire:post-single :post="$post" :key="$post->id"></livewire:post-single>
    @endforeach
</div>
```

post-create.blade.php view:
```php
<div class="mb-4">
	<form wire:submit.prevent="addPost">
		<div class="mb-3">
			<label for="body" class="sr-only">Your post</label>
			<textarea name="body" id="body" class="form-control" wire:model.debounce="body"></textarea>
			{{ $body }}
		</div>

		<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Post</button>
	</form>
</div>
```
1. in order to connect textarea with the component, we add `wire:model` directive, so PostCreate class or component will be aware of it, so we just add `$body` variable to class like shown at image below, this is something like two-way binding from other frameworks and they also utilize `model` pattern
2. `wire:submit.prevent` same as in Vue.js, it intercepts the usual flow and livewire takes over for submitting of the form, `addPost` method is added which we will find in PostCreate class

PostCreate class:
```php
namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;

class PostCreate extends Component
{
	public $body;

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.post-create');
    }

	public function addPost ()
	{
		auth()->user()->posts()->create(['body' => $this->body]);

		$this->body = null;
	}
}
```
1. `auth()` method works as usually so we can use it to grab the authenticated user
2. after we create a new post we need to reset `$body` variable
