In our example app we will fire event when post is added or created from PostCreate component, so we use `emit` method to fire the event and sending along side the data (there is also space for discussion should we send just the ID or everything?):
```php
namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;

class PostCreate extends Component
{
	public $body;

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.post-create');
    }

	public function addPost ()
	{
		$post = auth()->user()?->posts()->create(['body' => $this->body]);

		$this->emit('postAdded', $post->id);

		$this->body = null;
	}
}
```


so PostIndex will be changed so it can adapt for events:
```php
namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use App\Models\Post;
use Livewire\Component;

class PostIndex extends Component
{
	public $posts;

	protected $listeners = [
		'postAdded' => 'handlePostAdded',
	];

	public function handlePostAdded ($postId)
	{
		$this->posts->prepend(Post::find($postId));
	}

	public function mount ()
	{
		$this->posts = Post::latest()->get();
	}

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.post-index');
    }
}
```
1. Basically, we added `$post` variable so we can add it to `mount` method when a component is created and when an event is fired we can update that variable with `hablePostAdded` method
2. added `$listeners` array, we can have only keys without values, but if our method has different name then we need to use value in array
3. prepending post to `$post` collection

There is shorter version how to achieve same thing but with less code:

Here is necessary just to add method, which will trigger the rerender of component
