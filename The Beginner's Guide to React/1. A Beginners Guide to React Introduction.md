*Welcome to The Beginner’s Guide to React! I’m happy you’re here. I recommend that you watch all of these videos through once without touching the keyboard. Just take notes. Then you can watch them a second time and follow along and change/break the code and review the bits that you need. I’ll show you how I get things up and running, but feel free to copy/paste the code to an environment where you feel comfortable.*
