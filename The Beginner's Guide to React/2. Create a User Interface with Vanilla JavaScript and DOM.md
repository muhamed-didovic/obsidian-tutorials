*You can create a simple user interface on the web using HTML and CSS. But as soon as you want to make your application interactive, you need to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to listen to user events and make updates to the user interface. In this lesson we'll learn how to create a `<div>` element using raw JavaScript and browser APIs.*

In review, to create a user interface in JavaScript, you will need to have a place where you append your JavaScript-generated DOM elements. We're going to get access to that element from the document APIs. Then we'll create our own element. We'll add some properties onto that element. Then we'll append that element to our rootElement.

Code:
```js
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
    const element = document.createElement('div')
    element.textContent = 'Hello World'
    element.className = 'container'
    rootElement.appendChild(element)
  </script>
</body>
```
