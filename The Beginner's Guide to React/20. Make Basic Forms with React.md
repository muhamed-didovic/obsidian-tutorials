*Forms are a basic building block of the web. Every web application uses form elements as a way to accept input from the user. There are a few things to keep in mind with how forms work on the web and in this lesson we’ll learn about those as well as various ways you can retrieve values from elements in the form as well as a few best practices you should consider when working with form elements on the web.*

*You can learn more about basic forms in the React documentation about [Uncontrolled Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html).*

We have this `UsernameForm`. Right now, we're returning just todo: 
![[Pasted image 20221215075210.png]]

We want to return a form. I'm going to make a `form` element here. Then we'll make a `div` to hold our `label` username.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  return (
    <form> 
      <div>
        <label>Username:</label>
      </div>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Then we'll have an `input` of `type="text"` for our username input. Then we'll add a `button` of `type="submit"`. This is our submit button. We'll say submit.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  return (
    <form> 
      <div>
        <label>Username:</label>
        <input type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

We'll save that. We get a refresh. Here's our form. Awesome.

We could put an onClick handler on our submit button here. That would work OK when we click on this button, but forms are actually automatically submitted when you hit enter in an input within the form. People are typically used to that user experience.

What I'm going to do instead is we'll add an `onSubmit` handler on our `form`. If somebody clicks on the submit button or if they hit enter in this input, then our onSubmit handler is going to be called. Let's make a function called `handleSubmit`. Then we'll put that handleSubmit right in our form. We'll `console.log(submitted)`.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  function handleSubmit() {
    console.log('submitted')
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label>Username:</label>
        <input type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

We'll save that. Get a refresh. Type, "Joe." Hit Submit.

Huh, that's interesting. It goes away. Actually, if you watch closely, you'll see that it does log, but then we get a full page refresh. We can prove that by turning on preserve log. Then say, "Joe" again. Hit Submit. We get submitted and then navigated to that page.

The reason that this is happening is because when you submit a form in the browser, it automatically makes a post request to the current URL with the form data. We could see that if we looked at our network tab.

If you want to do some JavaScript stuff based on the user-submitted form, then we don't want the full page refresh. Instead, we can do our own JavaScript stuff. The `handleSubmit` function as an event handler will accept an `event` as the argument. Then we can say, `event.preventDefault()`. With that, we will no longer get a full page refresh. We'll still get the submitted string logged to the console.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.log('submitted')
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label>Username:</label>
        <input type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Our next step is to get the value out of this input because we want to alert the value that the user entered. We need to get our username equals something. We'll say, "Alert. You entered username." We can get rid of that console.log here. Then we can say, "Joe" and "You entered ?."

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const username = '??'
    alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label>Username:</label>
        <input type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

How are we going to get that username value? One way we could do this, we could say, `document.querySelector('input').value`." Save that. We say, "Joe." Submit that. Here we go. We get Joe in our alert.
![[Pasted image 20221215102222.png]]

That's not going to work very well. It won't scale super-well in the real world because the page could have multiple inputs. If we were to render multiples of these, then they could conflict with one another.

Querying the entire document breaks the encapsulation of this component because it means that you can't use this component in the context of other components in an application. We don't want to query the document.

Another thing we can do is we can access the form element from the event. We could say, `console.log(event.target)`. That is going to be our form element. We say, "Joe." Submit that. We'll get the form element in our dev tools.
![[Pasted image 20221215102804.png]]

That's great, but let's take a look at some of the properties on that form element. Chrome is rendering out this really cool DOM tree similar to what we see in the elements tab. I want to see the properties that are on the form element, so I'm going to use `console.dir`, which will log out the properties of that element.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.dir(event.target)
    const username = document.querySelector('input').value
    alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label>Username:</label>
        <input type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

We'll say, "Joe." Submit. Here we go. We have our form. Here there are a bunch of properties on here. 
![[Pasted image 20221215102901.png]]

We can see there's a zero and a one for input and button(scroll all the way to the bottom of the properties list). 
![[Pasted image 20221215102935.png]]
We could actually say, `username = event.target`. We want `[0].value`.

```jsx
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  console.dir(event.target)
  const username = event.target[0].value
  alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
}
```

We save this. We get Joe. We get our "You entered Joe" alert showing up. That works out nicely, but I'm going to get the username from another one of these properties.

Let's see. We've got elements right here. Elements has a zero and a one. We could say, `event.target.elements[0].value`. Save that. That will work as well
![[Pasted image 20221215103113.png]]

But I'm not super-jazzed about relying implicitly on the order in which these form elements appear. If I were to add another `input` just above our first div, then I'm going to be toast. It'll say you entered undefined.
![[Pasted image 20221215103146.png]]

don't want to rely on that. There's another thing that we can do here. That is by properly associating our label to the input by having an `htmlFor="usernameInput` in our label and then having an `id="usernameInput"` in our input, now the label and the input are properly associated, meaning that I can click on the label and it will focus on the input, which is good for accessibility.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.dir(event.target)
    const username = event.target.elements[0].value
    alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input id="usernameInput" type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
Image:
![[Pasted image 20221215103359.png]]

When I say "Joe" in here, hit submit, then we look at our form and our elements property, now in addition to the zero and one indexes for each of these `elements` we also get this username input value here because the ID of this element inside of our form. 
![[Pasted image 20221215103450.png]]

You actually get the same thing using the `name` attribute as well.
![[Pasted image 20221215103551.png]]

If we look at our form elements, we see that username input still exists right there. Any elements that have a name or an ID will be attached by that name and ID to this elements property of the form node. You can reference those by those names and IDs.

That's what we're going to prefer here. We'll say, `username = event.target` -- that's our form -- `.elements.usernameInput.value` to get the value out of that username input. With that, we can say, "Joe." We get everything working exactly as we want without the implicitness of querying the entire document or relying on the order of the elements.

```jsx
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  console.dir(event.target)
  const username = event.target.elements.usernameInput.value
  alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
}
```
Image:
![[Pasted image 20221215103718.png]]

Another thing that we could do is make a ref for our username input. We'll say `usernameInputRef = React.useRef()`. Then in our input, `ref={usernameInputRef}`. Instead of our current username, we could say, `username = usernameInputRef.current.value`. usernameInputRef.current will be the DOM node for the input. We'll get the value from that. This will work as well.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  const usernameInputRef = React.useRef()
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.dir(event.target)
    const username = usernameInputRef.current.value
    alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input ref={usernameInputRef} id="usernameInput" type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

![[Pasted image 20221215103836.png]]

There are a couple ways to do this. The reason that I removed `username = document.querySelector(input).value` is I really want you to please not use this. It breaks encapsulation of our components.

That's one of the things that we really love about React, is that we can encapsulate logic within our components. I don't recommend the `event.target[0].value` method or `event.target.elements[0].value` method
![[Pasted image 20221215103931.png]]
Because those implicitly rely on the order in which the elements are rendered and could easily break if you change that order. 

Either the one we are currently using or `event.target.elements.usernameInput.value` will work just fine:
![[Pasted image 20221215104057.png]]

Personally, I think that if you don't need a `ref` for the input that it's just easier to retrieve the input from the event target elements. It's recommended that you use HTML for an ID to associate labels to inputs anyway. Given that you already have to do that, this is the simplest way to get the value from the inputs in your form.

If I were writing this form today, this is what it would look like.

```jsx
function UsernameForm() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const username = event.target.elements.usernameInput.value
    alert(`You entered: ${username}`)
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="usernameInput">Username:</label>
        <input id="usernameInput" type="text" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In review, what we had to do here was we created a form that has a single input and label associated to that input and a button with the type of submit. It's really important that any button you put inside of a form has a type because implicitly it will have a type of submit. That's not entirely clear, especially if you say cancel for the contents.

With no specified type, that gives this button a submit type, which is really confusing. If you do want to have a cancel button or a reset button, then you want to specify the type is button:
![[Pasted image 20221215104252.png]]
which I know is a little redundant. If you don't specify a type, then the type will implicitly `submit`, which would really confuse your users when they try to click cancel.

We specify that type is `submit`. We put in submit for the value here. Instead of putting an onClick handler on the button, we put an onSubmit handler on the form. That way, any other way that the user tries to submit the form will call our submit handler.

To avoid a full page refresh, we use `event.preventDefault`. Then we retrieve the user's input using `event target` to get the form and then `elements` to get the elements of the form and `username input` to retrieve the input by its ID. Then we get the value from that input to get our username. Then we alert that to our users, or you could submit this to a back-end server.
