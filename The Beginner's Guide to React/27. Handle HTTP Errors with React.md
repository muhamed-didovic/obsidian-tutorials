*Unfortunately, sometimes a server request fails and we need to display a helpful error message to the user. In this lesson we’ll handle a promise rejection so we can collect that error information, and we’ll also learn how we can best display manage the state of our request so we have a deterministic render method to ensure we always show the user the proper information based on the current state of our React component.*

*A common mistake people make is to create a state variable called `isLoading` and set that to `true` or `false`. Instead, we’ll be using a `status` variable which can be set to `idle`, `pending`, `resolved`, or `rejected`. You can learn more about why this is important from [Stop using isLoading booleans](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-using-isloading-booleans).*

Now what would happen if there was some sort of server error or maybe we made the request incorrectly? Let's take a look here.

Let's go down to our query. We'll make a typo. We'll say, \"Nam\" instead of \"Name.\" We'll save that.
![[Pasted image 20221222074908.png]]

When I type in here, I can say, \"Mew\" and then submit. As a user, I'm just going to see this \"...\". That's not going to be useful at all. Let's see what's going on here in our developer tools. I'll go ahead and refresh.

We'll type Mew again. Let's clear out our network tab. Then we hit submit. We're going to get a network error indicating that we cannot query field nam on type Pokémon. It gives a suggestion for, \"Did you mean name?\"
![[Pasted image 20221222075220.png]]

The specific error is beside the point. We just need to show the user something a little bit more useful than leaving them in a loading state forever.

Let's come back up here before we fix our code. Let's add some state for the error state. We'll say setError. We'll initialize that to null. 
![[Pasted image 20221222080936.png]]

Then we'll say if there's an error, then we'll return, \"Oh, no...\"
![[Pasted image 20221222081013.png]]

In a real application, maybe you'd be a little bit more helpful than that. Let's add an error handler here as a second argument to our then call (fetchPokemon method). This will be our error data.
![[Pasted image 20221222081120.png]]

We'll say setError with the error data. Then we could submit that. We'll type the Pokémon name again. We see, \"Oh, no.\" Now we need to try again.

The problem that we'll face now is that if the user does try again and the server is successful, the way that we have our code structured is not going to work with that. What I'm going to do is I'm going to add a new state here for status.

We'll have setStatus. We'll initialize that status to idle, meaning right now the Pokemon info is not doing anything useful.
![[Pasted image 20221222081247.png]]

Then we can say that the idle status is when we want to render submitAPokemon. If the status is idle, then we'll say, \"submitAPokemon.\" 
![[Pasted image 20221222081408.png]]

When we start fetching a new Pokémon, then we can say, \"setStatus pending.\"
![[Pasted image 20221222081440.png]]

Then we can have this represent if the status is pending, then we want to return a \"...\" to indicate to the user that we're pending. 
![[Pasted image 20221222081511.png]]

When we have a successful request, then we can say, \"setStatus to resolved.\"
![[Pasted image 20221222081538.png]]

If we're resolved, then we want to return the Pokémon data. If the status is `resolved`, then we'll return the Pokémon data in a `pre tag` here.
![[Pasted image 20221222081616.png]]

Then if there's an error, we'll say, \"setStatus rejected.\" 
![[Pasted image 20221222081656.png]]

Down here, we'll say, if \"Status is rejected.\" Then we'll render, \"Oh, no.\"
![[Pasted image 20221222081738.png]]

Now our render method is very predictable. We always know when our component is going to render what. If I try to type in Mew again, we're going to see, \"Submit a Pokémon first.\"

We'll see \"...\" while it's pending. Then we'll see \"Oh, no.\" when it's been rejected.
![[Pasted image 20221222081926.png]]

We'll fix our typo right here. We'll save that. Now we see \"Submit a Pokémon\" because we're idle. We'll type in Mew. Hit submit.

We get that \"...\" Then we see Mew's details. If we try another Pokémon, then we'll see a \"...\" We'll see that Pokémon's details.
![[Pasted image 20221222082038.png]]

Let's go ahead and review. We added some error handling by creating some error state management. We added an error handler to our promise chain. If we get some error data, then we're going to set that error data so that we can render something useful to the user indicating that there's been a problem.

To avoid some state bugs, we added a status state so that we could start out with idle. When we start fetching the Pokémon, we can set it to pending. When we get the Pokémon, we can set it to resolved, or if there's a failure in getting the Pokémon, then we set it to rejected. That helps us to avoid bugs.
