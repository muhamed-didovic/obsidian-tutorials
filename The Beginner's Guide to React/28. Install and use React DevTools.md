*It’s dangerous to go alone. Here take this: [React DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en). The React Developer Tools extension is extremely useful in developing and debugging React applications. In this lesson we’ll get it installed and play around with some of the features. Definitely take some time to play around with the DevTools on your own. You’ll be using these a lot.*

Here, I can fill out a Pokémon name like Pikachu. I submit. I get some Pikachu data.

If I make a typo here, then I'm not going to get anything back. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100048.png]]

It might be useful for me to get an understanding of what's going on behind the scenes in the state of the components that I'm rendering to this page so that I can debug the problems that are happening in my components.

What I'm going to do is I'm going to Google React DevTools. That'll come up with the Chrome Web Store for React DevTools. There's also React DevTools supported for other browsers. I'm using Chrome, so I'm going to add this to Chrome. Click on \"Add Extension.\" Then React Developer Tools has been added to Chrome. I can use that by clicking on that icon.

When I come back to my app, I'll go ahead and refresh here. We'll see that Chrome extension icon for React DevTools has turned red. That's indicating to us that React is on this page and we're using the development build of React.
![[Pasted image 20221222100158.png]]

When we use the production build of React, then this will look a little differently. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100231.png]]

We can see that by going to twitter.com because Twitter is built using React. Here, this page is using the production build of React. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100415.png]]

If we close this and now I open up my DevTools, I can go inspect here, or I can go here to More Tools and Developer Tools.

That'll open up the Developer Tools here. If I click here and look at components, then this is going to show me the components that are driving this page. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100510.png]]

I can see that we have an `App` component 
![[Pasted image 20221222100557.png]]

and we have a `Pokémoninfo` component.
![[Pasted image 20221222100653.png]]

Under the `App` component, I can see all of the hooks that are being used for this app component to work. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100716.png]]

We have some state here that is an empty string. As I `type` in here and click submit, now we see that that state is what I typed. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100806.png]]

We can even change that value here. We can click `undo` if we want to undo that change, or we can hit enter to commit that value.

Now that value has been committed. You will see that we get null is printed because there is no Pokémon by the name of value.
![[Pasted image 20221222100854.png]]

If we change this to Mew and hit enter, then we're going to retrieve Mew's information. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100921.png]]

On the Pokémon info side, we can see the Pokémon name is coming in via props. 
![[Pasted image 20221222100949.png]]

We can actually change this prop to `Mewtwo`. Change that prop there.
![[Pasted image 20221222101026.png]]

Then we can also see the hooks that are being used by the Pokémon info component. We have `State: "resolved"`. We also have some more state for the Pokémon information itself and some more state(Basically pokemon info).  This is for our error state(`State: null` from picture above). We can see this hook also has an effect.

There are a lot of options that we have here. We can click on this. 
![[Pasted image 20221222101706.png]]

That will show me the source code for this particular component.
![[Pasted image 20221222101748.png]]

If we go back to our components here and click on this button,
![[Pasted image 20221222101842.png]]

then that will log this component's information to the console.
![[Pasted image 20221222101934.png]]

We can click that to expand it. We'll see the props, the hooks, and the root DOM node that's being rendered by this component. We'll come back here again.

We also have this button to inspect the matching DOM element. 
![[Pasted image 20221222102029.png]]

That'll take us straight to our elements tab here with that element highlighted. 
![[Pasted image 20221222102049.png]]

Then this is for Suspense.
![[Pasted image 20221222102111.png]]
If you're using any React Suspense components, you can test those out here by suspending the selected component. We also have some options here for the theme and the way that this is displayed.

Then we also have some view options for our components tab, where we can filter out different types of components or ever filter them out by their name.
![[Pasted image 20221222102212.png]]

If we wanted to get rid of that `App`, then we could type that in.
![[Pasted image 20221222102311.png]]

Now our app is no longer being shown. 
![[Pasted image 20221222102331.png]]
I do want to show that, so I'll remove that. Now our app is being shown.

We also have a profiler tab that will help us debug performance issues in our app.
![[Pasted image 20221222102400.png]]

We can enable record while each component is rendering. We can also hide commits below a certain threshold. If a commit is really fast -- maybe it only takes five milliseconds to update the DOM -- then we can enable that.

Now I can go to my profiler. We can hit this button to start profiling where we are, or we can hit this button to reload and start profiling when the page loads. We'll click on that. Then we can click stop. We'll see that there's no data matching the current filter criteria.

Let's go ahead and we'll uncheck this button. Now we can see that there was a commit. It just happened really fast. That commit was for the initial render of our component. We have our app and our Pokémon info. It says that this was rendered because it's the first time that it was rendered.
![[Pasted image 20221222102530.png]]

Now let's go ahead and do another recording. We'll say Mew. We'll submit that and then hit stop. We'll see a couple of commits here. 
![[Pasted image 20221222102629.png]]

For this one, it re-rendered because hooks changed and props changed.
![[Pasted image 20221222102648.png]]

For this one, it re-rendered because hooks changed. 
![[Pasted image 20221222102726.png]]

On this commit, it re-rendered because hooks changed again, so the data came back from the Pokémon request.
![[Pasted image 20221222102746.png]]

Then this re-rendered because we updated our state.
![[Pasted image 20221222102814.png]]

The React DevTools gives us this components and this profiler tab in our Developer Tools to give us a lot of insight into what our components are doing while we're developing them. Then we also have this indicator up here to tell us when we're using the development build of React versus the production build so we can make sure that our production application uses the production build.

One last pro tip I want to show you is if you open up the console while you have the components tab open -- you can do that by hitting the `escape` key -- then we have our console here. You can type $r. That will give you the hooks, the props, and the type for the component that you have currently selected.
![[Pasted image 20221222103010.png]]

We can click on the `App`. We can do $r again. Now we'll see the hooks, the props, and the type for that component that we have selected. 
![[Pasted image 20221222103116.png]]

This is actually very similar to the elements tab, where you can do a `$0`. That will give you the DOM node that you have currently selected in the elements tab. 
![[Pasted image 20221222103154.png]]

In the components tab, you have a $r. That will give you information on the component that you have currently selected.

I strongly advise that you install the React DevTools and play around with them so you become familiar with their capabilities and make you more productive developing React applications.
