So in previous lesson we saw how to create something with Vanilla JS, now let's see how it is done with React

The API is not exactly the same as the one that we get with the `document`. We do get to specify the type of element as the first argument, but instead of getting the element and attaching properties to it, we specify those properties on creation as an object.

Another difference is instead of text content, we specify children. Here we'll specify our children as Hello World and then the class name will be a container. This is going to give me my element, which I will render with ReactDOM to the root element. If we save this, we'll get a page refresh. You may not have even noticed that because it's rendering exactly the same thing that we had before.

Our final code looks like this:

Checking what is `element` or React element, Â We'll see that we have a `$$type` of property. That's a symbol and that's something for React to know that this object is a legitimate React element, `type` is a div and there are a couple other properties that are used by React internally. Then this `props` object is what we passed as our second argument here with the children and the class name:

We can also provide third argument to createElement method which will act as creation of `children`:

Adding more arguments will append to output:

In review, to create React elements and render them to the page, you need to include React and ReactDOM, React for creating the elements and ReactDOM for rendering those elements to the page.

Then we still need to get access to some element that's on the page so we can render our elements to that DOM node. Then we create our React elements and we use ReactDOM.render to render our element to the root DOM node.

Code:
```js
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
    const element = React.createElement('div', {
      className: 'container', 
      children: 'Hello World', //this is equal to element.textContent in Vanilla
    })
    ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
  </script>
</body>
```
