*React uses the same APIs to control and update the DOM that we did in the previous lesson. But it offers so much to the table that we’re going to introduce it into the project and rewrite what we’ve written to React code. Instead of creating DOM elements, we’ll create React elements and then hand those off to `react-dom` to handle turning those into DOM elements and putting them into the page.*

*If you’ve ever learned or used React before, you’re probably more familiar with JSX than React’s `createElement` API, but it’s important to understand the `createElement` API first so you understand the magic and can become a code magician yourself. Not to worry, we’ll get to JSX soon enough!*

So in previous lesson we saw how to create something with Vanilla JS, now let's see how it is done with React

The API is not exactly the same as the one that we get with the `document`. We do get to specify the type of element as the first argument, but instead of getting the element and attaching properties to it, we specify those properties on creation as an object.

Another difference is instead of text content, we specify children. Here we'll specify our children as Hello World and then the class name will be a container. This is going to give me my element, which I will render with ReactDOM to the root element. If we save this, we'll get a page refresh. You may not have even noticed that because it's rendering exactly the same thing that we had before.

Our final code looks like this:

Checking what is `element` or React element,  We'll see that we have a `$$type` of property. That's a symbol and that's something for React to know that this object is a legitimate React element, `type` is a div and there are a couple other properties that are used by React internally. Then this `props` object is what we passed as our second argument here with the children and the class name:

We can also provide third argument to createElement method which will act as creation of `children`:

Adding more arguments will append to output:

In review, to create React elements and render them to the page, you need to include React and ReactDOM, React for creating the elements and ReactDOM for rendering those elements to the page.

Then we still need to get access to some element that's on the page so we can render our elements to that DOM node. Then we create our React elements and we use ReactDOM.render to render our element to the root DOM node.

Code:
```js
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
    const element = React.createElement('div', {
      className: 'container', 
      children: 'Hello World', //this is equal to element.textContent in Vanilla
    })
    ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
  </script>
</body>
```

## Transcript
To use React to create this user interface, we're going to need to have React on the page. We can get React from npm, but there's a service called unpackage that we're going to use. If I go to unpackage.com that will show me how to use unpackage to get any file that is distributed on npm. It has these files for React. If I go to that file, then I'll see a minified version of React.

Let's go ahead and add some script tags to our page here so that we get React on the page. With React and ReactDOM both on the page, I can now create React elements and then use ReactDOM to render those elements to the page.

I'm going to comment all of this out and then with ReactDOM I'm going to render my element to the root element, but the element that I provide is not going to be a DOM element that I create with the document. Instead, it's going to be a React.createElement that I create with React.

The API is not exactly the same as the one that we get with document. We do get to specify the type of element as the first argument, but instead of getting the element and attaching properties to it, we specify those properties on creation as an object.

Another difference is instead of text content, we specify children. Here we'll specify our children as Hello World and then the class name will be a container. This is going to give me my element, which I will render with ReactDOM to the root element. If we save this, we'll get a page refresh. You may not have even noticed that because it's rendering exactly the same thing that we had before.

If we come down here to root, we'll see our div with a class container and the text content Hello World. We'll also see those two script tags that we added to add React and ReactDOM onto the page then our own JavaScript that we wrote to create this user interface.

Let's take a look at what this element is. If it's not a DOM node, then what is it? We'll console.log(element), save that, and then we'll come over here to our console. We'll see that we have a `$$ type of property`. That's a symbol and that's something for React to know that this object is a legitimate React element.

We know that the type is a div and there are a couple other properties that are used by React internally. Then this props object is what we passed as our second argument here with the children and the class name.

There's something interesting about this children prop that I want to show you here. You can write this same thing as a third argument to React.createElement by simply providing the value for the children prop. Here we can provide Hello World. Those are functionally equivalent.

If we look at the React element here, when you look at our props, and we still are getting children is Hello World. Then if you provide another argument, that will be an additional child. We can say comma, Goodbye World. Save that, we'll get a refresh, and we see Hello World, Goodbye World, and we get our element's props to be children as an array.

We can continue going on through children forever and ever. Or we could take these and use the children prop directly like this, specifying it as an array ourselves. You'll see that the result here is the same.

This also gives us the flexibility of creating additional React elements to be children. Here I could say React.createElement("span"). We could say we want no props for this span, and we want the children to be Hello and World.

We have the type of span, the props are null, the children are an array of "Hello" and "World". If we expand this, we'll see props, children, and children is just another React element that itself has props. And that children is an array of two strings.

In review, to create React elements and render them to the page, you need to include React and ReactDOM, React for creating the elements and ReactDOM for rendering those elements to the page.

Then we still need to get access to some element that's on the page so we can render our elements to that DOM node. Then we create our React elements and we use ReactDOM.render to render our element to the root DOM node.
