*It’s awesome that we can interact directly with React’s `createElement` API to create React elements and then hand those off to React DOM to get them to show up on the screen. But it’s not the most ergonomic API to write our UI code in. It’s hard to track when one element starts and the next one ends.*

*This is why the React team came up with JSX. It’s an extension to the JavaScript language to support syntax that looks similar to the HTML that you would write to create these DOM elements (there are [a handful of differences](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html)). JSX gives us an expressive syntax for representing our UI, without losing the benefits and powers of writing our UI in JavaScript. The best way to take advantage of this is to learn how JSX is compiled to regular JavaScript calls, so we’ll look into that a bit as well.*

Using React to create elements in this way works out just fine, but it's not entirely ergonomic. It's not the way that most of the community creates React elements. Most of the community is using JSX, which is an HTML-like syntax in our JavaScript.

In order to use JSX, we need a `Babel`(JavaScript compiler), which will transform JSX code into React code. As we can see from the image, compiled code looks like this: the type is div. There are the props, className is container, then all of the children come hereafter. I would recommend that you spend some time playing around with this tool. Understanding how JSX is compiled will make you more effective at using JSX.

In a typical application, you're going to be using a tool that will use Babel to compile JSX to JavaScript for you. For our purposes, we're going to use Babel in the browser to get this compiling our JavaScript right here without having to install any other tools. so we use this link:
```
https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js
```

So after adding `babel` script to our code we need to change also script type which has our code from `type="text/javascript"` to `type="text/babel"`, **so in end it will compile any script tag that has the type of text/babel**. Then it will create a new script tag with the compiled code with the type as text/JavaScript so that the browser can evaluate it.

After we run code we can see before ending `body` tag our code:

But in `head` tag we have compiled code:

In review, what we wanted to do here was make it so that we can author our UI without using the React createElement API and instead use JSX, which is an HTML-like syntax for authoring UI.

To do this, we need a compiler like Babel. We installed Babel standalone, which will compile our code on the fly in the browser. We also had to update our type to text/babel. Babel will look for all scripts that have that type, compile the code that's inside them, and insert a new script that has the compiled code so the browser can evaluate it.

In a typical application, you will not be using Babel standalone. Instead, you'll be using another tool which probably is using Babel to compile your code. That way, you get a much more friendly syntax for authoring your UI with React.

Final code:
```js
<body>

<div id="root"></div>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>

<script type="text/babel">

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')

const element = <div className="container">Hello World</div>

ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)

</script>

</body<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
  <script type="text/babel">
