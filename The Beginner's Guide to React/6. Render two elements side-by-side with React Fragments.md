*In React, you can’t render two React elements side-by-side (`<span>Hello</span><span>World</span>`). They have to be wrapped in another element (like a `<div>`). This may seem like an odd limitation, but when you think about the fact that JSX is compiled to `React.createElement` calls, it makes sense. In this lesson we’ll take a look at that and how to side-step this limitation with React Fragments.*

Let's say that instead of rendering a div with the class name container and then "Hello, World," we wanted to render two spans side by side, one that says "Hello" and the other that says "World." Let's first do this with React createElement, and then we'll see how we could do this with JSX.

I'm going to make my element React.createElement span. We don't need any props. Then we'll say, "Hello." We'll need another element. We'll call this our worldElement. Let's call this one our helloElement. This one will say, "World." How do you put two variables side by side and pass them both as the first argument? It's impossible:

This is straightforward to do in HTML, but it's not possible to do with React, which is why the React team created a special type of element called a React fragment. We can say React.createElement. React fragment is a type. We don't need any props for it. 
Then we can provide both of our children. Let's put this down here. We'll take our helloElement, pass that as the first child, and worldElement, pass that as the second child. Then this is going to get our element that we're going to render.  With that, we have the output that we're expecting.

Adding extra child which will act as a space:

So above example is done with React.createElement and React.Fragment which can be tedious, let's try same thing in JSX:

Because this is so common to do, JSX has a special syntax for React fragments. That is to simply remove the `React.fragment` text from tag and have an open and closing angle bracket. This is functionally equivalent to what we had before. This syntax is typically what I use whenever I need React fragments.
