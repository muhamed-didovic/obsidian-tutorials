*One of the biggest paradigm shifts that React offered to the UI ecosystem was the component model. It allows you to package up all the logic, styling, and layout of a unit of UI into a box that you can easily move around and reuse without exposing any of the implementation details of the component. You don’t have to understand how a component works internally to use it effectively. With idiomatic component architecture, rendering a component in one place won’t impact other parts of your app.*

In this lesson we’ll learn how to create a React component and how to use it. You’ll learn why things work the way they do and how to use this to your advantage.

So, here we have this div with the class name "container," and we have this div with the class name "message" in here that says "Hello, World!"
Let's say that I wanted to have, and I don't know, maybe two of those. So now we have "Hello, World!" and "Hello, World!" and then I don't want to repeat myself.

So I'm going to make a constant message here that is that "Hello, World!" and we'll put that in place of here "message," just interpolate that there. Now I'm not repeating myself, which is good.

But what if I wanted one of these to say, "Hello, World!" and the other to say, "Goodbye, World!" Well, we need to parameterize this somehow, and when we do that in JavaScript, we create a function. I'll make an arrow function here, and we'll accept an object. We'll call it "props," and then whatever that props.msg or props.message value is, is what we'll interpolate into the children prop for this div that we create

Now, instead of just putting "message" in there directly, we're going to call it with an object, and we'll use msg as "Hello, World!" and then we'll do this one msg "Goodbye, World!" Save that. And we get "Hello, World!" and "Goodbye, World!"

But again, this is not really ergonomic. It doesn't look very good, and one of the benefits to using JSX is the ability for our UI to resemble the declarative nature of HTML.

What I'd really like to be able to do is say "message" here and then "Hello, World!" and "message." (check image below) But if I try to do that, you'll notice we actually do get the "Hello, World!" but we're going to get a console warning here saying, "The tag message is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name in an upper case letter."
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201140637.png)

If we look at the compiled version of our code,  we're going to see React.createElement `message` as a string. That's problematic because we don't want to have the message as a string to create a DOM element that is a `message-type` element. We actually wanted to use this function, so that we can use this function to create additional React elements.
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201140735.png)

 So, as the warning suggests, we need to use an upper case letter, and so if instead, we say capital "Message," then we use capital "Message" here, and let's make sure we don't get errors here. So we'll say capital "Message" for these, and we can save that. Now, we're no longer getting that warning. If we look at our compiled code, we're going to see that capital "Message" here, and when we get past to React.createElement, we're going to get a capital Message right here, outside of a string.

if we ultimately look at what's rendered to the DOM, we see our ID of root, our container, and then we see a div with the class of message.
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201141447.png)

It's console.log that Message element. We'll look at our console, and we'll see that it is a React element and its type instead of being a div like we had before
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201141649.png)

let's take a look at that to compare, `console.log(div "Hello, World!" )` Save that and we'll get two console logs, so the first one being our div. The type is a string of div, whereas the type here is our `Message` function.
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201141800.png)

So, when you give a capital letter in JSX, that's the same as calling React.createElement with the function that you're referencing. That allows you to create a custom component that you can use to reuse code over and over again.
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201141946.png)

If we wanted to make it nice and declarative so that we could nest to these things as if it's the `children` prop, then we just accept children for the name of the prop. Then we can rename this one to "children," and those two are functionally equivalent. If we save this, then we'll still get "Hello World!" and "Goodbye, World!" 
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201142047.png)

But honestly, one of those looks a little bit nicer to me, so I'm going to switch both of these to use that syntax.
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221201142205.png)

What's cool about this is I'm also able to nest these together and pass anything that React can render, which includes the string here, or additional components:

or additional elements:

In a review of what we did here, we had some code that was being duplicated, and we wanted to reuse that code in multiple places. So, we created our own custom function component which is a function that accepts a props object and returns more React elements. We had to make sure that our function component started with a capital letter so that Babel would compile this to pass the function itself to React.createElement rather than the string message to React.createElement. That way, when React renders our element, it knows what function to call.

Code:
```js
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.8.3/babel.js"></script>
  <script type="text/babel">
    function Message({children}) {
      return <div className="message">{children}</div>
    }

    const element = (
      <div className="container">
        <Message>Hello World</Message>
        <Message>Goodbye World</Message>
      </div>
    )

    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'))
  </script>
</body>
```
