- Once you've figured out how React works locally in an index.html, you probably want to build an actual application and the best next place to start is by going to [codesandbox.io](codesandbox.io).

- There are a ton of things that you can do in CodeSandbox. You can add dependencies from npm, you can add external resources, you can even change your typeface.
- I can create a new repository. Example, CodeSandbox. We'll click Create Repository and CodeSandbox will create a repository on GitHub based on what I have right here.

- You can also deploy with Netlify.

- Within Netlify, you can even make a custom domain and so you could create an entire application using just CodeSandbox, Netlify, and GitHub.
