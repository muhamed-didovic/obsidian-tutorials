Computed values in Composition api, allow us to have a getter and a setter as well, especially if we want to bind something like form or similar

Let's try to write something into computed property:

We get an error if want to write to a computed value or property:

If we want to write something or to be precise use getter/setters, basically we will pass an object to `computed` function, this is good for example in forms when we need to write maybe all uppercase or lowercase or similar:

Code:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <input type="text" v-model="nameShouting">
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import {ref, computed} from "vue";
  export default {
    name: 'Home',
    setup() {
      const name = ref("");
      const nameShouting = computed({
        get: () => name.value.toUpperCase(),
        set: (value) => {
          name.value = value.toUpperCase()
        }
      })
      return {nameShouting}
    }
  }
</script>
```
