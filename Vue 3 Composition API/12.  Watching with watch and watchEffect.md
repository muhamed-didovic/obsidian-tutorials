`watchEffect` method periodically checks if there are any changes:

But if we want to change when ever number changes, then we need to add it for watching, `watchEffect` is good if we want to watch for multiple things in one batch:

`watch` method is different, it needs as first parameter what for should it watch:

also previous and new value is also available:

Example with `reactive`, difference from above is that as first parameter of `watch` method we need to pass function and return the value that we want to watch:

Watching `state` variable globally:

it wont work we need to add third argument to watch method and property `deep: true`:

we get `Obeserver` object each time when it changes:

Final code:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    {{number}}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import {ref, watchEffect, watch, reactive, toRefs} from "vue";
  export default {
    name: 'Home',
    setup() {
      const number = ref(0);
      const state = reactive({
        number: 0
      })
      setInterval(() => {
        state.number++;
      }, 1000)
      // watch(() => state.number, (number, previous) => {
      //   console.log("Changed", number, previous)
      // })

	  //watching for deep nested state
      watch(() => state, (state) => {
        console.log("Changed", state)
      }, {deep: true})
      return toRefs(state)
    }
  }
</script>
```
