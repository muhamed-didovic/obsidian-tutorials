Linking `about` page in Home.vue:

Main differences lies when we want to interact with routerm perhaps manually push to query string, push parameters to our routes, or redirecting

Also we can't access router with `this.$route` anymore in compositon api:

Let's see what is inside the second argument of `setup` method:

Second argument of `setup` method, there is `emit` method that we used already:

In order to access `router` instance there is `root` Vue instance as we can see and `$router` as well:

There is also `$route` object as well:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221115143955.png)

it contains info about the current route data or information:

So `setup` method acts as `created` hook, we can also redirect to a specific page or route as well in our example we are redirecting to `about` route:

Another example is to check if user has permissions to download something:

Final code
About.vue
```js
<template>
  About
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "About",
    data() {
      return {}
    }
  }
</script>

<style scoped>
</style>
```

Home.vue:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <router-link :to="{name: 'About'}">About</router-link>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import {useRouter} from "vue-router";
  export default {
    name: 'Home',
    setup(props, {root}) {
      const router = useRouter();
      router.replace({name: "About"})
      return {}
    }
  }
</script>
```
