Our Store example at store/index.js:
```js
import { createStore } from 'vuex'

export default createStore({
  state: {
    counter: 0
  },

  getters: {
    counter(state) {
      return state.counter
    }
  },

  mutations: {
    SET_COUNTER(state, value) {
      state.counter = value;
    }
  },

  actions: {
    incrementCounter({commit, state}, increment) {
      commit("SET_COUNTER", state.counter + increment)
    }
  },

  modules: {

  }
})
```

Adding `mapGetters` and `mapActions` to Home.vue and using them:

if we had `namedspaced` store under for example `counter` namespace it would be like this:

Adding the option to increment the counter, which will trigger the action and subsequentially the mutation:

next step is to see how to use this in composition api, like `router` we can't use `this` context like here for Vuex:

like we saw for `$router` we can access the `$store` from `root` Vue instance:

compostion api and vuex together, for reactivity needs we use `computed` property, and from `increment`  method we dispatch action `incrementCounter` which will trigger mutation as well:
