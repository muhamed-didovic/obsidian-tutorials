In composition api, we can't spread `mapGetters` and `mapActions` like we used before, let's see why, first lets see what is inside `mapGetters`:

we get object containing `mappedGetter` function:

so problem here is that we always get the function and not the property which can just write in template so we end up with function which we need to invoke it, there is a package which can help us here:

Using above package, we need to destructure `getters` in order to access it:

in the end we get the reactive objective:

we need to destructure the getter (even destructure more getters which makes code cleaner) and return it from the setup function:

Adding actions as well and use increment action to increment the counter:

we can also use arrays instead of objects:

Regarding Namespaced modules, for example, we have auth.js module, how do we use it in Home.vue component:

Home.vue component, it seems that we can't use array access with namespaces modules:

Instead, we use object:
