What if we want to use `reactive` and destructure features so it is more convenient to access it in templates?

Starting component:

A hidden gem is a method `toRefs` and let's update our code:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221110130821.png)

Result of consoling out the fields above:

First object is the observer:

Adding `ref` as well besides other options and comparing them:

As we can see `toRefs` basically is more or less the same as `ref` beside it is just an object containing `RefImple` objects:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221110131136.png)

so basically `toRefs` takes `reactive` object and wraps it with `RefImpl` object:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221110131303.png)

So we have two ways to return `toRefs`, first way is directly in return statement:

Second way is useful when there is more stuff that we return from `setup` method:

Final code:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    {{name}} {{password}} {{number}}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import {reactive, toRefs, ref} from "vue";
  export default {
    name: 'Home',
    setup() {
      const form = reactive({
        name: "alex",
        password: "password"
      })
      const number = ref(0);
      setTimeout(() => {
        form.name = "Billy"
        number.value = 1
      }, 1000)
      console.log(toRefs(form))
      return {...toRefs(form), number}
    }
  }
</script>
```
