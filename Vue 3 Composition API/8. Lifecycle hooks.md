There are some changes in lifecycle hooks in Vue3.

Before in Vue2 there were two methods: `created` and `beforeCreated` hooks, these hooks fire before a component is mounted to DOM, so replacement in Vue3 for these methods is just a `setup` method.

Another method that we used a lot was `mounted`, for example, we wound use that hook to send request to an API, in Vue2 that would look like this with options API:

In Vue3 above example would look like this, few important things everything happens in `setup`  method, add `onMounted` method for lifecycle hook, lack of `this` keyword or context in setup method, also it seems like we have initialization and then later we update `users` variable with data needed, also code extraction if now quite simpler:

The same example, just instead of `ref` we use `reactive`, here `reactive` is useful or good when we want to set up multiple pieces of data  like `users` and `pagination`:

`reactive` example:

`onUpdated` hook:

Final code:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">{{user.name}}</div>
    <div v-for="user in users2" :key="user.id">{{user.name}}</div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import {ref, onMounted, reactive, toRefs} from "vue";
  export default {
    name: 'Home',
    setup() {
      const users = ref([]);
      const state = reactive({
        users2: []
      })
      const getUsers = () => {
        users.value = [
          {id: 1, name: "Alex"},
          {id: 2, name: "Billy"}
        ]
        state.users2 = [
          {id: 1, name: "Alex"},
          {id: 2, name: "Billy"}
        ]
      }
      onMounted(() => {
        getUsers()
      })
      return {users, ...toRefs(state)}
    }
  }
</script>
```
