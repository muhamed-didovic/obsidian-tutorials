In Vue2, two elements or divs like in below code couldn't be added to template, so there can be only one root element, in Vue3 that is changed, there are now fragments that are virtual DOM elements and they are not added to DOM tree
```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    Hello
  </div>
  <div>
    Hello
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    //
  }
</script>
```

SO running above code in Vue3 works:
