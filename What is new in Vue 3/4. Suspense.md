Suspense is related to the state of the app, and is added for example for APIs when we are waiting for their response

In Vue3 if we use API requests we can get this error, which tell us that we should use suspense feature:

Adding suspense feature(check image below), we are wrapping everything with Suspense element and inside of it we have two template elements, one is labeled as `fallback` which is show while request is not done and on the contrary we have template with label `default`:

So for start we will create some components and our folder structure will look like this:

App.vue with Suspense feature, here suspense is waiting for both components to finish their requests and loading, adding error handling takes care of both components, another thing that you can see below is `ref` keyword, which is basically used as reactive variable and in order to update it we need to use `.value` syntax like in our example `error.value = true`:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="error">
      Could not load
    </div>
    <Suspense v-else>
      <template #default>
        <TopPosts />
        <LatestPosts />
      </template>
      <template #fallback>
        <div>Loading...</div>
      </template>
    </Suspense>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import TopPosts from './components/TopPosts.vue'
  import LatestPosts from './components/LatestPosts.vue'

  import { ref, onErrorCaptured } from 'vue'

  export default {
    components: {
      TopPosts,
      LatestPosts
    },

    setup () {
      const error = ref(false)

      onErrorCaptured(e => {
        error.value = true
        return true
      })

      return {
        error
      }
    }
  }
</script>

```

When adding error handling it takes care of both components:

TodoIndex.vue component, here we use `setup` method from composition api, so whatever we return from `setup` method it is available inside `template` element like `posts` resource or variable
```js
<template>
  <div>
    {{ todos }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import axios from 'axios'

  export default {
    async setup () {
      const todos = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')

      return {
        todos
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

LatestPosts.vue:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    {{ posts }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import axios from 'axios'

  export default {
    async setup () {
      const posts = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')

      console.log('latest posts loaded')

      return {
        posts
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

TopPosts.vue:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    {{ posts }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import axios from 'axios'

  export default {
    async setup () {
      const posts = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')

      console.log('top posts loaded')

      return {
        posts
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```
