In Vue2 we used Options API in Vue3 it is called Composition API , and Options API typically looked like this:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108091754.png)

Reason for the change to Composition API was opportunity to build more in structured way from before, so you code tends to be  cleaner, also Options API is available in Vue3 

Counter.vue
- `setup` method is introduced in Vue3 so we can expose variables and etc
-  in order to use reactivity of Vue.js we need to use `ref` from Vue.js and apply it to variable so it is available in the template part, it is generally used for single values
-  to expose variable to template we need to add it to `return` statement like seen below in example 
- for events, we also add in the `setup` method like the increment event or method in example below, aslo we need to add it to `return` statement of `setup` method, also one thing to consider here is we can now easy export/import these methods where ever we need them and that is the point of composition API
- in the increment method for the number variable we added `.value`, it is importantt to add that otherwise our variable wont be reactive and we add it when we want variable to change the value, in template we don't need to add `.value` that part will be done automatically 
```js
<template>
  <a href="#" @click.prevent="increment">Increment</a> {{ number }}
</template>

<script>
  import { ref } from 'vue'
  
  export default {
    setup () {
      const number = ref(0)

      function increment () {
        number.value++
      }

      return {
        number,
        increment
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Adding counter to main App.vue:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108093634.png)

Form.vue
-  here we check v-model for forms
-  we could create two variables for two fields in form like:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108095910.png)
- Adding Form.vue to App.vue instead of Counter.js
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108100023.png)
- Result:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108100054.png)
- The old way with options api was to use object:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108100428.png)
- in Vue3 there is also other option or way using `reactive` function from Vue.js, the later option is generally used when we have object or properties and we want reactivity on them
- so we defined `state` variable which will hold the values of the form:
```js
<template>
  <form action="#" @submit.prevent="submit">
    <input type="text" v-model="state.form.email">
    <input type="password" v-model="state.form.password">

    <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
  import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'

  export default {
    setup () {
      const state = reactive({
        form: {
          email: '',
          password: ''
        }
      })

      function submit () {
        console.log(state.form);
      }

      return {
        state,
        submit
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```
- so result is `proxy` object not the plain object:

- Passing props to component in Vue3, passing string to component, old way to pass props to component in Vue2:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108105421.png)
- even in Vue3, we still want to use `props` so we enforce some rules, Body.vue:
```js
<template>
  <p>{{ text }}</p>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    props: {
      text: {
        required: true,
        type: String
      }
    },
    
    setup (props) {
      
    }
  }
</script>
```
- Adding Body.vue js in main App.vue entry point:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108110216.png)
- In order to access props in Body.vue component, we need to add `props` as parameter to `setup` method:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108110358.png)
- Creating two-way  binding in vue3:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108110611.png)
- Another note, if we destructure props and take `text` property and apply two-way binding there as well it won't work, reactivity is in parent component
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108110731.png)
- in Vue2 we would do something like this regarding computed properties:
- computed properties in Vue3, we add `computed` method form Vue.js for computed properties, BodyComputed.vue:
```js
<template>
  <p>{{ text }} is now {{ uppercase }}</p>
</template>

<script>
  import { computed } from 'vue'

  export default {
    props: {
      text: {
        required: true,
        type: String
      }
    },
    
    setup (props) {
      const uppercase = computed(() => props.text.toUpperCase())

      return {
        uppercase
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

- watchers in Vue3, there are two functions for watchers `watchEffect` method and `watch` method,  watchEffect just watches for a particular value, on the contrary watch method gives us previous value as well:
```js
 import { ref, watchEffect, watch } from 'vue'

  export default {
    setup () {
      const number = ref(0)

      setInterval(() => {
        number.value += 1
      }, 1000)

      // watchEffect(() => {
      //   console.log(number.value)
      // })

      watch(number, (number, previous) => {
        console.log(`changed from ${previous} to ${number}`)
      })

      return {
        number
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```
- Lifecycle in vue2: 
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108112203.png)
- Lifecycle in vue3 for mountend and unmonunted methods:
```js 
<template>
  <div></div>
</template>

<script>
  import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'
  
  export default {
    setup () {
      onMounted(() => {
        console.log('component mounted')
      })

      onUnmounted(() => {
        console.log('component unmounted')
      })
    }
  }
</script>

```
- Adding code in App.vue to unmount or destroy component:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108112516.png)
- Vue2 reuse code:
![](./assets/Pasted%20image%2020221108112945.png)
- Vue3 how to reuse code in files nad reuse them, reuse.vue:
```js
<template>
  <div>
    {{ x }} {{ y }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import { useMousePosition } from '../mouse.js'

  export default {
    setup () {
      // destructuring
      const { x, y } = useMousePosition()

      return {
        x,
        y
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```
- so conevntion is when we take something from composition setup method, we prefix it with `use` word, mouse.js
```js
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

export function useMousePosition() {
  const x = ref(0)
  const y = ref(0)

  function update (e) {
    x.value = e.pageX
    y.value = e.pageY
  }

  onMounted(() => {
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', update)
  })

  return {
    x,
    y
  }
}
```
